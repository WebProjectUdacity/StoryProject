Steps to join us!

Step 1: everyone can join our discord and take part in the discussion. Our repository is public, therefor you can download it, look through our code and get familiar with the way we are working. And feel free to ask questions, there are no stupid questions!

Step 2: If you feel like you are ready to work with us and still want to join us (no matter what your skill set is :slight_smile: we are here to learn! ) youâ€™ll get an invite on github, then you can push your changes and actively work on the project. This step is meant to reduce the chaos of new people joining, and pushing lots of new builds :slight_smile:

Step 3: Since we are slowly getting to a point where we have to discuss about features, weather we should Implement them or not, and how we should Implement them, we have to consider the opinions of all members. If you are not that active we canâ€™t wait for your opnion. So if you are actively participating you will become a Contributor. It is like being a full part of the team, with admin rights and so on (that doesnâ€™t mean that we wonâ€™t take opinions of non contributors into consideration, they matter as well ðŸ˜‰ )
