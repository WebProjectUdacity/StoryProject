A Dragon's tale

Right past the Mirrored Hills, which seperated the Drakont Plains and the  Fallen Lands, there was a small town, with more than 2000 inhabitants next to a huge lake. There wasn't an attack from the Fallen in hundreds of years now and therefore the people lived in safety.
It was a normal day, the town was alive and well, people walking along the streets, salesmen trying to sell their goods, everything was fine. A group of boys was playing at the lake, fighting with with wooden swords when suddenly a louad roar appeard.

It was coming from the middle of the lake, where a huge bulge of water started to form. Then a creature started to rise from the depths, with a huge head and a long neck, dark blue skin which looked like it was made out of stone. While it was still slowly raising up it held its arms right in front of its body.
The Hands had huge claws, which looked like they could easily sink into two humans at once. The boys ran, screaming, except one. He was frozen from the fear, scared, he couldn't move or do anything else except staring at the face of that enormous creature, with its hundreds of teeth, and its bright blue eyes like blazing fire.

A female  voice interrupted his staring, brought him back to consciousness.
"Edward!"
