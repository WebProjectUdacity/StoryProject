# Project TODO List

- [ ] Make the write page unaccessible to the unregistered visitor;
- [ ] A script that will automatically merge the file$.txt into a signle one before adding it to the Stories database (for a better access when making a list of the existing stories - I guess);
- [ ] A comments functionality on the finished stories;
- [ ] A user dashboard to see your activity;
- [ ] Think about the timer and voting thing;
- [ ] Maybe reduce the part2 of the write page, make the text area smaller?;
- [ ] Widget to change the font-family of the write page paragraphs:
    * Monotype Corsiva (Default)
    * Apple Chancery
    * Arial
    * Helvetica
    * Times
    * Verdana
    * Palatino
    * Georgia
    * Trebuchet MS
    - [ ] Manage OS and Browser Fonts compatibility
      * Monotype Corsiva
      * Apple Chancery

- [ ] Add the ability to suggest changes to the existing parts of the story 
- [ ] Add the ability to create character sheets for existing and new characters 
- [ ] Add some kind of moderation group (I would like to add a system where moderators are automatically chosen by their activity and the amounts of votes they get,  but I am not sure how reliable that might be)
